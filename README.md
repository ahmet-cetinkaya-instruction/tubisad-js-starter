# TUBISAD Frontend Javascript Training

This repository is a snapshot created for documentation and knowledge-sharing purposes, capturing the content of a technical training delivered for a specific audience. The training focused on fundamental and advanced features of JavaScript.

## Main Covered Topics

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, operators, conditional statements (if/else, switch-case), and loops (for, forEach).
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions, arrow functions, and default parameters.
- **Scope**: Global, function, and block scope, including differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays and objects (JSON), including value vs. reference types.
- **Advanced Array Methods**: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for data manipulation.
- **ES6+ Features**:
  - **Destructuring**: Simplifying access to array elements and object properties.
  - **Rest and Spread Operators**: Handling variable function arguments and expanding iterables.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - **Classes and Constructors**: Creating objects with `class` and `constructor`.
  - **Inheritance**: Extending classes with `extends`.
  - **Modularity**: Structuring code with `import` and `export`.
  - **SOLID Principles**: Practical implementation of SOLID principles through a logging example (e.g., `BaseLogger`, `FileLogger`, `SmsLogger`).
